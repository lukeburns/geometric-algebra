## Introduction

*Geometric algebra* is a language that generalizes vectors to higher dimensional objects. Vectors are useful for encoding the notion of a directed line segment, and we find that the extension of this to *bivectors* (as oriented planes), *trivectors* (as oriented volumes), and *k-vectors* (as oriented k-dimensional volumes), leads one to rich and robust algebraic structures grounded in geometric meanings. **k** is called the **grade** of a vector. Naturally, 0-vectors are simply magnitudes (real numbers) with no dimensionality at all.

I will use italics to indicate a word that the reader is not yet expected to know, using context to facilitate the learning of its meaning. Bolded font is used to indicate that I believe the meaning of the word has been sufficiently communicated. If you come across a bolded word, and do not know what I mean, re-read! I will use the strategy of introducing axioms as they're needed and will consider that I've accomplished my job if I am able to help you learn how to use the concepts here productively and consistently.

My mission here is to formalize the notion of grade using a product called the *geometric product* and introduce you to new objects of mixed grade called *multivectors*, in particular certain multivectors called *spinors*.

## The Geometric Product

The *geometric product* of two vectors $a, b \in \mathbb{R}^\infty$ is denoted $ab$.

In order to make sense of what this product might mean, we can separate the product into a *symmetric* part and an *anti-symmetric* part.

$$ab = \frac{1}{2}(ab + ba) + \frac{1}{2}(ab - ba)$$

The **symmetric** term is 

$$\frac{1}{2}(ab + ba) = \frac{1}{2}(ba + ab),$$ 

and the **anti-symmetric** term is 

$$\frac{1}{2}(ab - ba) = - \frac{1}{2}(ba - ab).$$

#### The symmetric term

If $a$ is parallel to $b$, or formally $a = cb$ for some real number $c$, then the anti-symmetric term vanishes, since scalars commute with vectors:

$$ab = \frac{1}{2}c(b^2 + b^2) + \frac{1}{2}c(b^2 - b^2) = c b^2.$$

We still have to make sense of $b^2$, and we'll do this shortly.

#### The anti-symmetric term

If the notion of collinearity is naturally encoded by a vanishing anti-symmetric term, then let's define orthogonality by a vanishing symmetric term. 

To formalize this, we can decompose $a$ into two terms $a = a_\parallel + a_\perp$, where $a_\parallel$ is parallel to $b$ and $a_\perp$ is orthogonal to $b$. 

If we endow the geometric product with distributivity, then

$$ab = (a_\parallel + a_\perp) b = a_\parallel b + a_\perp b.$$

We showed above that

$$a_\parallel b = \frac{1}{2}(a_\parallel b + b a_\parallel),$$

and our definition of orthogonality is that

$$a_\perp b = \frac{1}{2}(a_\perp b - b a_\perp).$$

These two facts imply the stronger statements that

$$a_\parallel b = \frac{1}{2}(ab + ba) = b a_\parallel,$$ 

and

$$a_\perp b = \frac{1}{2}(ab - ba) = - b a_\perp.$$


#### Grade

The geometric algebra $G$ consists of all things that can be generated by sums and products of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^\infty$.

The product of $k$ orthogonal vectors $A = a_1 a_2 ... a_n$ is called an **k-vector**, or sometimes a **k-blade**. These define subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^\infty$. The grade of $A$ refers to the number of linearly independent vectors needed to define it. For instance, $a_\perp b$ is a 2-vector, or more commonly a bivector, and it determines a two-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^\infty$.

An arbitrary element $M \in G$ is called a **multivector** and consists of a sum over k-vectors. For example, the sum of a scalar and a bivector is a multivector. We will see some examples of multivectors that produce rotations, and other transformations, of k-vectors.

But what about the product of parallel vectors? What is the grade of $a^2$ and $b^2$, for instance? If we endow the geometric product with associativity, then we can determine their grade by considering the square of a bivector:

$$(a_\perp b)^2 = a_\perp b a_\perp b = -a_\perp (a_\perp b^2) = - (a_\perp b^2) a_\perp.$$

In particular, the facts

$$a_\perp (a_\perp b^2) = (a_\perp b^2) a_\perp$$

and

$$a_\parallel (a_\parallel b^2) = (a_\parallel b^2) a_\parallel$$

tell us that

$$a (ab^2) = (ab^2) a$$

for arbitrary vectors $a$ and $b$. That is, $ab^2$ commutes with $a$.

It can be shown that $a b^2$ must be a vector (WIP: use the fact that this holds for all $a$ and $b$ and eliminate all other possibilities. suppose it is a scalar, then it commutes with everything, in particular something orthogonal to $a$ and $b$. etc, etc. scalars are the only objects to commute with all vectors in $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ and hence all k-vectors.), and since it commutes, $a b^2$ is a vector parallel to $a$, and therefore must be a scalar multiple. Hence, $a^2, b^2 \in \mathbb{R}$.

In general, $a_\parallel = cb$ for some scalar $c$, so

$$\frac{1}{2}(ab + ba) = a_\parallel b = c b^2$$

is has grade 0 as well. Hence, $ab$ is the sum of a scalar and a bivector.
